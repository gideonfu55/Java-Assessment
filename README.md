# Java-Assessment

●	What did you like about this project?

This was an extremely challenging project, and I'm not sure if I can say I enjoyed the process, but it did show me the huge gaps in my understanding of OOP and what I would need to improve on.

●	What did you struggle with in this project?

Everything, I would certainly need to revise on what was covered during the programme for Java.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

There is a huge step up from the previous exercise in CourseService, so I think I may need more practices and time to grasp the concepts better.
